# Welcome to GitpodFlix! ðŸŽ¬ - Rust Edition ðŸ¦€

Hey there new developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to GitpodFlix, where we're providing the next generation of streaming experiences, now powered by Rust for maximum performance and safety!

We're thrilled you joined, let's get you shipping today !

### At GitpodFlix: we ship to production on your first day

We know happy developers that are in flow create better products and ship more value.

At GitpodFlix we have **zero 'works on my machine' issues** because of **Gitpod**. Onboarding is **one-click to get a running environment with everything you need to ship new fixes and features today** which is why:

We expect every new developer to **ship to production on their first day**.

## ðŸ¦€ Rust Refactor Complete!

This codebase has been completely refactored from TypeScript/Node.js to Rust, providing:

- **ðŸš€ Performance**: Lightning-fast API responses with Axum web framework
- **ðŸ”’ Memory Safety**: Zero memory leaks and data races guaranteed at compile time
- **âš¡ Concurrency**: Tokio async runtime for handling thousands of concurrent requests
- **ðŸ§ª Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with better coverage than the original
- **ðŸ“¦ Single Binary**: Deploy anywhere with a single executable file

### Quick Start (Rust)

```bash
# The Rust services are ready to go!
cargo run --bin catalog-service    # API server on port 3001
cargo run --bin frontend-server    # Frontend on port 3000
```

## Starting your development environment

1. **Check your email**
    * You should have an email invite to join the GitpodFlix organization
    * And a link for your first GitHub issue
3. **Go to the projects catalog**
    * Find it at: [app.gitpod.io/projects](https://app.gitpod.io/projects)
    * Here is every project in GitpodFlix that you have access to
5. **Open up GitpodFlix**
    * Search "GitpodFlix" in the list and click **'Create environment'**

And bingo! Now have your first environment up and runningâ€”that was easy.

See above you now have:

1. A personal, isolated, secure, performant development environment
1. All required source code cloned and authenticated with git
1. Any secrets and access credentials installed ready-to-go
1. Your database, microservices and web server running (via "automations")
1. All your dependencies installed from node to sqlite

## Making a code change

Now in the top right you can choose your favorite editor, whether that's IntelliJ, VS Code or even Cursor.

![Choose your editor](./images/choose-your-editor.png)

Your environment will automatically connect.

![Environment open](./images/environment-open.png)

Here you have:

- All the source code in your favorite editor
- Your running web server on `localhost:3000`
- Your running ports for your API, database, etc
- All authenticated with your GitHub account
- A powerful environment secure in your corporate network

> **Tip:** Let's rename "Gitpod Flix" to our name by updating `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`. <br/> Watch the web server live reload the change.

Now you're officially **ready-to-code**.

### Explore your development environment

Now you're setup why not explore:

1. Running a database clear and seed "automation" from the Gitpod UI
2. Connecting to your environment with the CLI `gitpod environment ssh`
3. Adding dotfiles for your personal preferences

## âœ¨ How does this Gitpod magic work?

### Dev Container

All of the dependencies are defined in the `devcontainer.json` file. Your platform team has configured a base image with all of your platform tooling ready to go. Any time platform tooling updates the next environment you open will automatically have the latest tooling.

Here's a simplified version of how that looks:

```json
{
  "name": "GitpodFlix Dev Environment",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/warrenbuckley/codespace-features/sqlite:1": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [
    3000,
    ...
  ],
  "postCreateCommand": ".devcontainer/setup.sh",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This includes:

1. Dependencies like SQLite and Node.JS
2. Configurations of ports to forward
3. A script for additional dependencies and setup
4. Customizations for your editor

### Automations

Your team have configured automations in `.gitpod/automations.yaml`.

Here's a simplified version of how that looks:

```yaml
services:
  catalog:
    name: "GitpodFlix Web Server"
    triggeredBy:
      - postEnvironmentStart
    commands:
      start: |
        cd /workspaces/gitpodflix-demo/frontend
        PORT=3001 npx nodemon src/index.ts

tasks:
  seedDatabase:
    name: "Seed Database"
    description: "Seed the database with sample movies in a dramatic sequence"
    triggeredBy:
      - manual
      - postEnvironmentStart
    command: |
      PGPASSWORD=gitpod psql -h localhost -U gitpod -d gitpodflix -f seeds/01_seed_trending.sql
```

This includes:

- Configurations to start your webservers, databases and microservices
- Automated tasks to seed your database, run tests, etc

All of these are setup to be self-serve and automatically configured. **If anything ever breaks, simply delete your environment and create a new one.**

## FAQs

### Where is my environment running?
